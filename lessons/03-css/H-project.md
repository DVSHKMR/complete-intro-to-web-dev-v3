Let's do a project together.

This will stretch you a bit and make you use everything we learned together. It's a bit advance but you have the skills to do it.

We're going to make the checkout page for a coffee app. It looks like this:

![Coffee app design](/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/images/coffee_masters.png)

Some notes:

- [The logo for Coffee Masters is here.](/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/images/coffee_masters_logo.png)
- We didn't talk about how to make rounded corners. It's with [border-radius][border-radius].
- There are many ways to do this. Flex and grid would work well, just don't go overboard with grid, it'd be hard to 100% handle this layout in just grid.
- HTML inputs can be styled with HTML just as you expect.
- We also didn't talk about box shadows. You can give it the nice little shadow effect with [the CSS property box-shadow][box-shadow].

This time I'm going to make you write both the HTML and the CSS. Consider this a capstone project for the first two sections!
